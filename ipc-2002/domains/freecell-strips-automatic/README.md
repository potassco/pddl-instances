# FreeCell (STRIPS, For Automatic Planners)

## Domain Description

In order to confirm that STRIPS planning is still advancing, we chose this domain from IPC 2.
It is the familiar solitaire game found on many computers, involving moving cards from an initial tableau, constrained by tight restrictions, to achieve a final suit-sorted collection of stacks.
