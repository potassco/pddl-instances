# Child Snack (Sequential, Satisficing)

## Domain Description

This domain is to plan how to make and serve sandwiches for a group of children in which some are allergic to gluten.
There are two actions for making sandwiches from their ingredients.
The first one makes a sandwich and the second one makes a sandwich taking into account that all ingredients are gluten-free.
There are also actions to put a sandwich on a tray and to serve sandwiches.

Problems in this domain define the ingredients to make sandwiches at the initial state.
Goals consist of having all kids served with a sandwich to which they are not allergic.
