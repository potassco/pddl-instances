# Assembly (Round 1, ADL)

## Domain Description

The goal is to assemble a complex object made out of subassemblies.
The sequence of steps must obey a given partial order.
In addition, through poor engineering design, many subassemblies must be installed temporarily in one assembly, then removed and given a permanent home in another.

## Additional Notes

There are two slight different versions of the domain ([version 1][1], [version 2][2]).
As it is unclear which version is considered official, version 1 was selected because it is closer to modern PDDL.

Some instances have received bug fixes between the publication of the [original instance archive][4] and the [revised one][5] (this concerns instances 7, 12, 13, 14, 19, and 27).
The corrected instances are included here.
The original instances can be found in the [additional notes][3] directory for reference.
